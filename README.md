## Digital Security
Navigating the digital world without getting screwed over is like trying to get through a minefield blindfolded. But hey, you've got me, and I've got your back. Let's crack on and armor up your digital life.

## Why should you care? Understanding Risks
Thinking you're not a target for cybercrime 'cause you're "just an average Joe" is like leaving your front door wide open because you think burglars only hit mansions. Spoiler: they don't give a damn. They'll ransack your cozy cottage just as quickly as a penthouse if the door's unlocked. Every piece of personal data you've got – it's like cash in your drawer. Would you leave that out in the open? Heck no. Cybersecurity isn't about being paranoid; it's about not being the low-hanging fruit that gets picked first when the thieves come prowling. So lock it down, armor up, and make those data-grubbing gremlins work for nothing.

### Open Sourced Software vs Closed Sourced
**Closed source software** is a sketchy van with "free candy" – a damn magic show of smoke and mirrors. You don't know the hell inside or want to find out what's behind the curtain. **Open source** is your neighborhood watch, transparent like a local theater with every script and hiccup out in the open. Bugs and flaws are aired out and squashed fast, keeping your digital life solid with open sourced tools like **Firefox**, **LibreOffice**, and **GIMP** for all your browsing, docs, and image editing. Stick with open source, always search for that option first, it's less of a gamble.

### Secure Password Practices
Listen up, folks: Passwords are the guardians of your digital realm, and "password123" just won't cut it — it's like securing your fortress with a string. Throw in a cocktail of uppercases, numbers, and symbols like they're the secret ingredients to your security recipe with a minimum character limit of 15. And don't go repeating them like a broken record across different sites; that's a hacker's buffet. Craft a passphrase mighty enough to make a Russian hacker throw in the towel — imagine ‘2B||!2B_That-IsThe?’. It's a nod to Shakespeare, and a middle finger to cyber thieves.

### Password Managers
Think of password managers as badass vaults that keep your secret codes safer than gold in a bank. You only need to remember one super-strong password, and it locks down all your other ones. But don’t screw up and forget this big one, or you’re toast.so make it very complex and yet memorable (at least 30 character long)

Here's the deal: We're all sick of trying to remember a zillion passwords, right? Without a password manager, trying to remember all your passwords is a hot mess. It's like trying to count squirrels on a sugar rush. So, check out these rock-solid, open-source password managers:

**• Bitwarden**: It's solid and simple to use. You can get to your passwords from anywhere, and they're all under serious lock and key. **[Click Here For Bitwarden](https://vault.bitwarden.com/)** 

_**I Highly recommend bitwarden since it has a cloud version so you just download the app, create an account and it's available everywhere. 
I personally use it on a daily basis and have over 600 accounts saved on it, including bank accounts, credit cards, secure notes, websites logins, MFA codes, and other files that need to be secure.**_

**• KeePassXC**: No frills, just tough-as-nails security. You handle everything, which means no online shenanigans with your info. **[Click Here For KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)** 

_**This solution is for people who wants their password managers to be completely offline which is fine but less convenient**_

**• LessPass**: This one’s clever. It makes up new passwords for you every time, based on some math magic and your one big password. **[Click Here For LessPass](https://www.lesspass.com/)** 


**PS: DO NOT get a service like LastPass, Dashlane, Keeper or 1Password, or anything other than what I recommended to you, they are closed sourced programs, badly audited and have been breached many times (_[Here's Proof](https://password-managers.bestreviews.net/faq/which-password-managers-have-been-hacked/)_).The ones I've mentioned have been working on a zero knowledge protocol and have been secure since day one and will remain as such.**

Get yourself one of these, and you can forget about password panic for good. Just set it up and chill.

### Multi factor authentication (MFA) and Security Keys

Your password is your first line of defense, and a damn good one is non-negotiable. But even the mightiest password needs a wingman, and that's where multi-factor authentication (MFA) comes in. It’s essential, like that extra shot in your morning coffee. 
Use open sourced apps like **[Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/)**  for android and **[Raivo OTP](https://raivo-otp.com/)**  for iOS, and if you gave bitwarden premium you can store your MFA codes there too and have faster access but it's not a must, just convenience.

Some services like microsoft have their own authenticator to manage their office account and there's no way around it so use **[Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/mobile-authenticator-app)** for their services but not as your main MFA app, same goes with **[Twilio Authy](https://authy.com/download/)** with services like **twitch**.

_I don't trust closed sourced software because once a breach happens you will be freaking out if your data was leaked._

Another form of MFA is the use of security keys.
Think of security keys as your own personal cyber SWAT team. They're compact devices that act as a physical passkey to your online life. Unlike a password, which a sly hacker could snag, a security key is a tangible, uncrackable piece of hardware. You plug it in or tap it for near-unbreakable access control — it's the real-world equivalent of a retinal scan in those spy movies.

So, why not just MFA? Because even a code can be phished, intercepted, or swiped by a keen-eyed looky-loo. But a security key? You might as well be wearing an invisibility cloak.

Want to bulletproof your data? Get a security key. Brands like **[ONLYKEY](https://onlykey.io/collections/all)**, **[YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/)** , or **[Google Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key)** are the gold standard. They're the extra mile you run to ensure that the only person getting into your accounts is you. No key, no entry. It's peace of mind in a world full of digital pickpockets.

_I Personally use ONLYKEY because it's opensourced and has way too much customisation which I love, but for simplicity I suggest getting a yubikey with NFC or a good Titan Key, and if you feel more confortable with them and want to be very tech savvy then buy an ONLYKEY, you'll love them all_

### Avoiding Scams and Frauds
Scams are like cockroaches on the web – turn on the light, and they scatter. So keep your BS detector on high. Lottery wins from lotteries you never entered? Foreign dignitaries with cash problems? That's not your lucky day calling; that's trouble knocking.

### Recognizing Phishing Attempts
Phishing emails are the sleazy con artists of the internet, dolled up with urgent subjects but sloppy as a drunk at closing time. They'll promise you a lottery win or spook you with a hacked account alert, all shinier and faker than a plastic gold watch. And then there's the attachments—digital trojan horses packed to the brim with malware nastier than a virus on a hospital keyboard. Keep your eyes peeled for sender emails that look like a keyboard smash, links that reek of scam like a week-old fish in the sun, and grammar so butchered it’s like they threw the dictionary in a blender. Don’t be tempted by their attached crap—could be a ransomware grenade waiting to blow your digital life to smithereens. Any click could be the mousetrap—so if it whiffs of bullshit, hit delete faster than you’d swipe left on a bad dating profile.

### Safe Browsing Habits
When you're cruising through the internet's backstreets, make damn sure you're rolling with 'https' and a padlock by your side. That 's' isn't just for show; it's your bulletproof vest. Without it, you're just asking to get mugged. And if your browser starts screaming "Get the hell out!" with its warnings, you best listen or you're asking for trouble.

### Using Public Wi-Fi (Free Wi-Fi)
Jumping on public Wi-Fi without protection is like skinny-dipping in a swamp full of gators. Sure, splash around for the harmless stuff, but when it comes to the juicy bits of your digital life, cloak up with a **VPN**. It's like hiding in plain sight from the cyber-vultures circling overhead.

**If you want to get a vpn service, then I highly recommend checking this website that dissect each service and how good it is**: **[Click Here](https://www.techlore.tech/vpn)**

### Basic Cyber Hygiene
Keep your digital hygiene tighter than your grandma's Tupperware. Don't leave your gadgets logged in or your info spread out like an all-you-can-steal buffet. Treat your personal details like they're gold dust – because in the wrong hands, buddy, they're dynamite.

### Protecting Personal Data
Your personal data is your secret sauce – don't go splashing it all over the internet like hot sauce on a taco. Dial those privacy settings to 'Fortress' and remember: the net's got a longer memory than the elephant in the room.

### Software Updates and Backups
Slam that update button like it's an annoying alarm clock. It's not nagging; it's nudging you away from a cliff. And backups? That's your safety net when you're walking the high wire over the pit of digital despair. No backup, no pity party.

**_Your digital life’s a juicy steak in a world full of wolves. Lock it down with gnarly passwords and be stingy with your data—don’t splash it around like cheap beer at a dive bar. Encrypt your stuff with open source and VPNs like they’re freakin' superpowers. Updates? Hit ‘em hard and fast. Backups? Hell yeah, like your life's a non-stop action movie. Stay sharp, play it smart, and keep the digital bloodsuckers thirsty. Now go own the net like a boss._**

## Suggested Apps
Here’s a list of apps that you must have in Lancaster as a student:

## iLancaster: 

This app will be your everyday guide throughout the campus, whether its classes, marks, laundry, fixing an issue, library, modules, and other. You can download it from here: **[iLancaster](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/mobile)** 

Here’s a list of notable features:

**Self Check-in**: The professor won’t check you in for class; you will do it yourself through the app. Just go to the calendar section, open the day’s session, and you can check in 5 min before the start of the lecture.
_Fun tip_: If you’re not feeling like attending, you can check in outside the class, just be close enough to the room.

**Map**: It’s similar to mazemaps but more oriented for the campus. It displays available PC spaces, laundry space availability, buses, food places, and even booking spaces.

**FixAFault**: If anything is broken in your building, report it with FixAFault, and it will be sorted. You can access it through iLancaster or through this link: **[Click Here](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/itpi/fix)** 

And if you want more information on this, follow this link: **[Click Here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/campus/campus-services/maintenance-and-upkeep/report-a-fault-with-on-campus-facilities)** 

**Interactive Transcript**: Once your marks are released, you can see them in the interactive transcript section or at this link: **[Click Here](https://mylusi.lancaster.ac.uk/AcademicMarks)** 

**Library**: This link provides everything you need when it comes to the library, including study space booking, reporting noise, and seeing any fines. Here’s a list of library and other links:

*[Database of resources](https://lancaster.libguides.com/az.php)* | *[Resources List](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/study/library/resources/resource-lists)* | *[Library Opening Hours](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/study/library/visiting)*

*[Request a book that’s not in the library](https://resource-request.library.lancs.ac.uk)* | *[Book appointments with faculty](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/contact/library/library-teaching-and-engagement-team)* | *[Information about different facilities on campus](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/campus/study-and-social-spaces)*

*[Booking study spaces](https://lancaster-uk.libcal.com/r)* | *[PC Labs](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/campus/study-and-social-spaces/pc-labs)* | *[Term Dates and Calendar](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/study/term-dates-calendar)*

**Laundry**: You can check the availability of the launderettes through iLancaster and pay for the washing through the *[Circuit app](https://www.circuit.co.uk/how-to-guides/circuit-laundry-app)*. I advise using PayPal to get a faster refund in case any issues occur.



### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_


## Navigation Apps 
### Mazemaps, Google Maps, StageCoach, and Waze:

When it comes to navigating on campus, it’s better to use *[MazeMaps](https://www.mazemap.com)* since it shows every room on campus (including which floor), but if it glitches out, you can always use *[Google Maps](https://maps.google.com)*  and get close enough to find your way.

When it comes to city navigation, then trust Google Maps for the route, and  *[StageCoach](https://www.stagecoachbus.com/promos-and-offers/national/stagecoachbusapp)* for the exact bus time. 
*[Waze](https://www.waze.com/apps)* is a great option if you have a car as it is updated by the community, and if there’s any issue on the road, you’ll be the first to know.

### _**[Press to go back](https://far-oda.github.io/Lancaster-University-Survival-Guide/#list-of-content)**_

## Banking: 
This one is the most crucial thing you need to do. When it comes to banking in the UK, it’s hard to open an account since you’re new, got no credit, and if you live on campus, you don't have the council tax or a gas/water/electricity bill to prove your accommodation. So what is a student to do?!

Well, here are a few things that you should know!
It’s easier to open an account through the app than in a branch. It asks for the same details as the bank does, but it uses your **correct address and phone’s GPS** to confirm your address. Then, once it verifies it, it sends a code through the post as a confirmation for your address, and then you’re in the clear.

_All banks have direct transfers and international transfers but I'll be mentioning the cash method  incase you want to use it like I did_

### Physical Banks: 
Most of them are much less feature-rich than digital banks, but people feel more secure with them since if they have an issue, they go to a branch and sort it out (digital banks can do the same through online chat, though).

#### • Lloyds
This bank is considered the easiest and the friendliest physical bank to sign up with. They are receptive to students, and their sign-up process through the app and the website is quite simple (It does take a long time sometimes to get approved). You can pay in up to **£2,995 cash a month** over the Post Office.

#### • Barclays
This bank is considered one of the few good banks in the UK, but opening an account with them is simpler using the bank mobile app than in person. It has a **£3000** cash deposit limit per transaction and up to **£10000** in cash **annually** at the Post Office.

#### • HSBC
This bank is by far the worst in terms of opening an account. You can’t open one through the app; it has to be done through the website. You will probably have to visit the branch to finish the registration, but it’s worth it if you will deal with cash and the Post Office deposits since it has the highest limit of **£3000 a day** and **£20000 a year**.


### Digital Banks:

#### • Starling
Don’t be afraid of digital banks in the UK; they are insured just like a physical one but with less hassle and more features.
Starling is quite simple to open, and the process is quite quick (a few days).

It has a feature called **Spaces** where you can divide your capital into spaces to compartmentalise your expenses, and the best part, you can have up to **5 digital cards** and link them to those spaces and use them separately. 
Such as a space for this month’s food, another for bills, another for entertainment such as clubbing, a stash for emergencies, and one for rent. See, told you it’s good, and obviously, you can do direct payments and scheduled payments using them as well.

For security reasons, you can **set a limit** for each card, **freeze them**, and even **limit features**.

It has a feature that shows you the graph of your spending and which category you splurge on the most. And if you have a pal with a Starling account too, you can pay them through NFC — no need for an account number or sort code. You can also request money through a link, have different exchange currencies, and deposit checks and cash at any postal office.

• Sign up here: **[Click Here](https://www.starlingbank.com/)** 

_**PS: I do not recommend using monzo at all, they reject a lot of people for no reason, have very strict limits on cash usage, and their fees are high.**_

#### • Revolut/Wise
Same vibe as Starling but with their own twists. **Revolut** has this one-time credit card deal where you make a purchase and bam! The card number changes to protect your privacy. And don’t fret about refunds; if you ask for one, the money gets zapped back to your main account.

#### • Wise
is your globe-trotter buddy with support for many worldwide currencies, so you can shuffle your dough between your currency and GBP with low fees.

• Sign up here for **Revolut**:  **[Click Here](https://revolut.com/)** 

• Sign up here for **Wise**:  **[Click Here](https://wise.com/)** 

### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_

## Banking Addons

### Google Wallet/Apple Wallet
It's a no-brainer to add your cards to a digital wallet, so you've got your finances at your fingertips—no need for an old-school wallet, just your phone.

• Sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://wallet.google)** 

### PayPal
Once you've got your bank sorted, hook yourself up with a PayPal account. Sometimes websites give the cold shoulder to certain cards due to region restrictions, but they'll roll out the red carpet for PayPal—even though it's the same card. Don't ask why, it's just how it is.

• Sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://py.pl/)** 


### Splitwise
Got friends and a head for keeping tabs on who owes what? Splitwise is your savior. It’s a free online service where everyone can log their debts, ditching the embarrassment or awkwardness of money talk. They'll nudge you regularly until you square up, keeping everyone's conscience squeaky clean.

• Sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://www.splitwise.com)** 

## Transfer Fees
Converting your cash to GBP comes with choices:

### Direct Wire Transfers
This is just your standard bank-to-bank shuffle using your **IBAN**. It's usually pricier than something like **Western Union**, but it's all about what you’re comfy with.

### Cash Deposit Method
Another route is using an international credit card from your international bank, load up on GBP, yank it out of any free ATMs (don't forget the receipt), and deposit that wad at the postal office into your UK bank account. 
Typically, this method's fees are less brutal than wire transfers, but remember the varying cash limits for each bank (hence me mentioning it before).

### Cryptocurrency
And then there's the wildcard—Binance (cryptocurrency). I'm not handing out cigars for this method to newbies since if you don’t know your stuff, better to steer clear. But if you're willing to get a tad risky with the crypto scene to dodge high fees, here’s the drill:

Head over to the **P2P exchange** tab in **Binance**, snap up a stable coin like **USDT (Tether)** from a seller who isn’t a fee hog. 
You'll handle the purchase with your usual bank transfer, which doesn't cost a dime. 

Once you've got the coins, sell them on for **P2P exchange in the UK**, and they'll direct transfer the money to your bank for zero fees.

_**The risky bit?**_ 
Even though the market has mood swings and stable coins tend to just chill, if something funky happens (not that Binance is shady or anything), folks might panic and make moves they'll regret—like trying to play the market. 
Beginners, keep your hands to yourselves here.

### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_

## Internet/Ethernet
The campus's internet is managed by eduroam, which means if you've set it up, you can still get access to eduroam in the city where it's supported.

Here’s a detailed page regarding that:  **[Click Here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/wi-fi)** 

If you love the stable connection of Ethernet, then you have to set it up manually by adding your device's MAC address to the PASS page:  **[Click Here](https://pass.lancs.ac.uk/pass)**

## Something is broken

### Issues with account and IT
In this case, you need to contact ISS directly, either through their live chat or by calling them. You can find more information here: **[Click Here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/it-help)** 

### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_

### Health
When it comes to health in the UK, the NHS is the main entity, and frankly speaking, it's pretty dreadful, to say the least. 
_When I got sick, I couldn't get antibiotics, which I needed because the GP said I didn't need them, while my doctors back home said that I did. So, not the best experience._ 
Here’s a link for health on campus: **[Click Here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/campus/campus-services/health-services-on-campus)** 

_**I highly advise you to bring any prescription medication that is vital to your health with you from your country or on your next visit there, just in case your GP is as useless as mine was.**_

#### Physical wellness (Gym)
The gym is not only for getting your muscles big and losing weight, but it also provides great stress relief, which is vital while studying. 

Most of the sports activities on campus are done there; they also provide classes, fun activities like badminton, and great guidance from coaches in general. 

_**I highly recommend a gold membership, or a silver one if the activities are not your thing.**_

• Sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/campus/campus-services/sports-centre-and-student-membership)** 

#### Sleep
**Please sleep for at least 7-8 hours**. 
It’s hard during assignments, but believe me, it's better to get the rest and do the work in the morning than stay up like a zombie all night and get barely anything done. 

The mattresses in the accommodation are not the best, so if you're having back pain, get yourself a good mattress.

#### Mental Wellness
If you have any wellbeing problems, then you can always ask for help. 

And if you need a therapist, the university provides a service with **Spectrum Life**. 

Email them and say that you need a therapist to help with wellbeing issues; tell them that you need a face-to-face or a phone therapist and that the guides on ask are not enough for you.

• Their Email: [counselling@lancaster.ac.uk](mailto:counselling@lancaster.ac.uk)*

#### Religion
For those who practice religion, you can continue to do so at the Chaplaincy Centre: **[Click Here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/campus/chaplaincy-centre)**

## Saving Money
We students are broke, having given our last penny to the educational system. So what is a person to do? 
There are a few places to save, such as student programs, cheap stores, and free events.

### Food 
In Lancaster, there are a few stores for food where they provide good quality food cheaper than stores like Sainsbury's and M&S.

#### Farmfoods/Iceland/Home Bargains/Poundland
If you need to buy things in bulk and cheap, then these stores are the place to be. 
Usually, Farmfoods has more options, but all of them are pretty decent, especially for frozen goods.

#### Aldi/Asda/Sainsbury's
Each of these has their own perk. 
For instance, **Aldi** has cheap alternatives to named brands, **Asda** is a cheaper alternative to Sainsbury's for online shopping, and **Sainsbury's** shines if you have a _Nectar card_ where you can save with Nectar prices.

#### Uber Eats/Deliveroo/Just Eat 
Some days you don't want to cook, so your options are to starve, which won’t last long, or order takeout.

• You can get Deliveroo Plus for free with Amazon Prime here:  **[Click Here](https://deliveroo.co.uk/amazon-prime?utm_source=deliveroo_android_account_link)** 

### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_

### Clothes
If you want cheap clothes but not bad quality, then **Primark** is your friend. 
They have a huge selection of everything. And if that's not to your liking, then there's **Sports Direct**, but you'll have to head to Morecambe for that.

### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_

### Discount Programs

_**As a student, you're given discounts throughout the UK. Just ask any store if they have a student discount, and most likely they do. You show your student ID and get the discount, that simple.**_

Schemes such as **UniDays**, **Student Beans**, and **NUS Totum** offer discounts on all sorts of clothing brands, technology, and activities, both in-store and online.

• For UniDays, sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://www.myunidays.com/GB/en-GB)** 

• For Student Beans, sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://www.studentbeans.com/uk)** 

• For Totum, sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://totum.com)** 

### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_

### Travel 
_**For traveling by train, it's best to get a railcard for the year; it will provide a 1/3 saving on each trip. It will pay for itself in just a few trips, costing only £30 a year or £70 for 3 years.**_

• For a Railcard, sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://www.16-25railcard.co.uk)** 

This works for people aged 16-25. 

If you are above that, then you can **[Click Here](https://www.railcard.co.uk)** instead, which is the same price but doesn't offer a 3-year plan. 

You can get the 16-25 without the 3 year offer if you fill out a special form as a student: **[Click To Download it Here](https://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/download/clientfiles/files/Online%20Generic%20Railcards%20Application%20Form%20-%20Print%20at%20Home%20-%20Oct%202023.pdf)**

As for the busses themselves, you will find that 100 and 4 are the **slowest**. 40, 1A, and 1 are the **fastest**, and 41 and 42 are the **mid**.

Regarding the bus passes, If you use the bus more than 4 times a week then definitely get a bus pass, same goes for daily passes if you have more than one trip a day. 

### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_

#### Amazon Shipping and Lockers
To save money on shipping costs, get Amazon Prime free for 6 months using UniDays, and then the cost is 50% off on yearly Prime from that point. 

You will get access to Prime Video, a free monthly book from Audible, 1 free Prime sub for Twitch, free shipping, and obviously Prime Day deals. 

_**And when you need to return any item, use the Royal Mail option with a QR code or the Amazon Locker.**_

• For Amazon Prime, sign up here (Do it through UniDays):  **[Click Here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/joinstudent)** 

### _**[Press to go back](#list-of-content)**_

#### Mobile Plans
If you need a good provider that has cheap deals and good service, then I highly recommend **Voxi**, which is supported by Vodafone 5G. 

I’ve tried most of them, and this one is just right. 

• For Voxi, sign up here:  **[Click Here](https://join.voxi.co.uk/)**

## Jobs
As a student, you might wanna work to support those extra expenses. **I don't recommend snagging a job since it's better to focus on your studies**, but if you reckon you can juggle the two, then here's the scoop. 

You can work up to **20 hours a week**, which is **part-time**.

Usually, they'll hand you around **15 hours a week**.

## Fun
There’s many ways to have fun on campus, you don’t have to be a hermit and just study.

### Social hub/Trips
Most of the graduate events will be held at social hub, whether they are official or not so feel free to go there from time to time and meet new people and have fun with the games and activities available on site. 

I highly recommend participate in every activity the grad college organises as it will help you keep your sanity and discuss hardships with students who are going through the same thing.

All of the upcoming events are advertised on instagram, and available on libcal.

### Sugarhouse/Vibe/Greens/Craftys/Generations
When it comes to clubbing then there’s plenty of places in town to do so. 

**Sugarhouse** is run by student union for only students and they have safety as No 1 priority which is always a plus.

**Vibe** has a great selection of songs and open to everyone but still as safe as sugar in my opinion.

**Greens** and **Craftys** are bars/club which are very similar to bars on campus but open to everyone.

**Generations** which is an LGBTQ+ club which has a fun atmosphere and open till 4 AM.

### Going Back Home
with clubbing comes going home eventually. 

If you go out and coming back after 12 AM then the only bus available back to underpass in the **N1 bus** which runs on the weekend **every half an hour till 3 am**, and then you’ll either **walk back** or **order a taxi**.

**• Order a taxi**

In lancaster there's 3 taxi companies: **848 Taxis**, **32090 Taxis**, and **Coastal Taxis.** They accept cash and card.

_**Uber** very rarely works in lancaster._

_**I Highly advise to book a taxi half a day in advanced if there's a festival/event/holiday going on, since the sheer amount of people coming back will create traffic and you don't want to be waiting for a taxi in the cold rain, while hungover.**_

_PS: Never settle with one service, call all three for the quota, to get the cheapest price available._

**To Call 848 Taxis**: **[01524848848](tel:01524848848)** 

**To Call 32090 Taxis**: **[0152432090](tel:0152432090)** 

**To Call Coastal Taxis**: **[0152460000](tel:0152460000)**

## Travelling outside UK
If you want to go home for the holidays or in the Easter break or anytime period, you should contact your department and confirm if you need permission to do so as some projects will prevent you from leaving and terminate your visa if you do as a security precaution.

## Final thoughts
Reflecting on the past year, I realize it's been a journey rich with diverse experiences. I made it a point to attend various events, opening myself up to the joy of new friendships. While not all connections flourished, the ones that did have been incredibly meaningful. This taught me an important lesson: don't be discouraged by setbacks; rather, embrace the opportunity to engage with others.

Dedication marked my approach to studies—I committed wholeheartedly, actively participating in lectures and seeking guidance from professors whenever necessary. This not only helped me academically but also fostered valuable relationships across the academic community. Through these interactions, I learned the importance of networking and staying abreast with my coursework, which also helped me connect with fellow students.

This year has been transformative; it has encouraged an introverted individual like me to step out of my shell. I've become more open, friendly, and eager to assist others. This experience has shown me that such a transformation is possible for anyone willing to embrace it.

The opportunity to immerse oneself in such an experience comes once in a lifetime. I encourage you to savor every moment and venture beyond your comfort zone. There is so much to gain, and you might find that the only regret is in holding back. Embrace the experience in its entirety—you never know where it might lead you.
